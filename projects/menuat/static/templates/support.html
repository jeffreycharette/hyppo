			<h2>13. Assignment</h2>
			<p>Menuatmay assign this Agreement or any part of it without restrictions. You may not assign this Agreement or any part of it to any third party.</p>
			<h2>14. Entire agreement</h2>
			<p>This Agreement together with the Menuat Privacy Policy, (the Agreements) constitutes all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Menuat and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to Menuat are void.

			<h2>15. Severability</h2>
			<p>Should for any reason or to any extent any provision of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
			<h2>16. Mandatory arbitration; exceptions to mandatory arbitration, waiver of class action rights; limitations period; venue and choice of law</h2>
			<p>i. You and Menuat agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Menuat Service or your use thereof, including our Agreement, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Menuat are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Menuat subscription. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement, and as administered by the AAA. ii. You and Menuat agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of the Menuat Service are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and Menuat agree that the preceding claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by Courts of competent jurisdiction in Saint Augustine, Florida, and that applicable Florida and/or Federal law shall govern, without regarding to choice of law principals. iii. YOU AND Menuat AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, the arbitrator shall not consolidate any other person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief. iv. Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by Menuat. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed "excessive" will be paid by Menuat. v. You and Menuat agree that this Agreement involves interstate commerce and is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Menuat further agree that applicable laws of the State of Florida shall exclusively govern any dispute without regard to choice or conflicts of law rules. The sole and exclusive venue for the resolution of any dispute, whether or not subject to mandatory arbitration as described above, shall lie in Saint Augustine, Florida.</p>
			<h2>17. English version prevails</h2>
			<p>In the event that this Agreement is translated into other languages and there is a discrepancy between the two language versions, the English language version shall prevail to the extent that such discrepancy is the result of an error in translation.
