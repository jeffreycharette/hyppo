					<h1>Our Story</h1>
					<hr />
					<h4>“We come from a long line of Hyppos...”</h4>
					<p>In the early months of 2010 Stephen DiMare was working in Montana for a winter at the Lodge at Big Sky and flew home to St. Augustine for a friend's wedding. On the flight he pitched his idea for a coffee shop to the (random) nice woman sitting next to him. She told him that what he needed in his coffee shop was popsicles, gourmet popsicles in the Mexican style. Stephen listened as she explained that paletas (Spanish for popsicle) could contain anything from cucumbers to fresh pineapple to jalapeños.</p>
					<p>With his interest piqued, Stephen returned to Montana to finish the winter ski season. He bought a set of cheap plastic ice pop molds and spent his evenings trying different combinations of flavors (as there is nothing to do in Montana after dark) and let the guests at the hotel try them and give feedback. When he came back to St. Augustine in April he had enough money saved to buy some semi-industrial popsicle molds from Brazil and pay first and last months' rent on a little retail space in downtown St. Augustine. The slow economy had made available several spots in the busy tourist area that otherwise would have been out of the league of someone starting with so little. The shop opened for business on June 5 after lots of support from friends and family volunteering to paint and hauling freezers (up stairs, no less!). Despite a hilarious string of experiments and missteps trying to figure out larger-scale popsicle production, Stephen eventually succeeded in meeting demand (although many nights were spent sleeping on the floor at the shop).</p>
					<p>The idea behind the pops was simple - fresh fruit, cane sugar, and whatever other interesting things might go along with those. The pops struck a chord with locals and tourists alike looking for an alternative treat to enjoy on those blazing summer days. The community came out in force to support one of their own on a new, if quaint, venture. Over 100,000 popsicles later, the Hyppo has expanded into a new space on a corner in downtown St. Augustine and continues to vend fresh pops to the downtown crowd. The pops are all now made on larger, much more efficient pieces of equipment that exist in the back of The Hyppo Cafe, a shop in midtown St. Augustine that brings the life and vibrancy of fresh foods to the genres of sandwiches, confections, and coffee. The Hyppo continues to delight customers with inventive combinations afforded by simple ingredients.</p>

					<h1>About Stephen DiMare</h1>
					<hr />
					<h4>“Popcicle Entrepreneur Extraordinaire”</h4>
					<p>Entrepreneur Stephen DiMare began The Hyppo as a humble popsicle stand in historic downtown Staint Augustine in 2009. Seeking to combine organic and local-when-we-can-get-it produce in delightful new ways. DiMare&apos;s pops became instantly popular with locals, students, and visitors alike. With unsusal flavors like Cucumber Lemon Mint, Melon &amp; Cracked Pepper, and Elvis (peanut butter, honey, and banana) it was only a matter of time before DiMare&apos;s culinary creativity leapfrogged the deep freezer into sandwiches, salads, and gourmet coffee drinks.</p>
					<p>So why The Hyppo, you ask? Our hometown, Saint Augustine, was named such because it was discovered on the day of the Feast of Saint Augustine of Hippo. So, when our founder sat pondering a place for Saint Augustinians to feast on the freshest local/organic produce, it seemed only right to name it after our city&apos;s patron saint: or rather, a certain hungry animal that he happened to share a moniker with. Our flagship store sits on Hypolita Stree, so we adopted a y instead of an i to make sure everyone knows we are 100% home-grown.</p>
